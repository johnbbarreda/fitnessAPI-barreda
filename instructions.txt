Create a simple Fitness Tracker: 
Build a fitness tracking application where users can log their workouts and track their progress over time:
    Each workout document should include name, duration, dateAdded and status
    A user should be able to register and login only with their email and password
    User should be able to retrieve their user details
    A user should be able to add, retrieve, update, and delete workouts
        Users can only access their own workout documents
Other requirements:
    All routes should be able to respond with the correct and appropriate HTTP status codes
    Create a fitnessApp.json in the project folder and add all available routes:
        {
            "endpoints": {
                "login":"/login",
                "register":"/register",
                "addWorkout": "/addWorkout",
                "getMyWorkouts":"/getMyWorkouts",
                "updateWorkout":"/updateWorkout",
                "deleteWorkout":"/deleteWorkout",
                "completeWorkoutStatus":"/completeWorkoutStatus"
            }
        }
    No admin validation, this is a personal application
    Do not pass id in the request body
